## How to use

### Instructions for Updating the `data.js` File

Follow these step-by-step instructions to customize the `data.js` file with your personal information and project details for your application.

#### Step 1: Locate the `data.js` File

Open your project directory using your preferred code editor.

#### Step 2: Edit the `data.js` File

In the project directory, navigate to `/src/utils/data`.

Open the `data.js` file for editing.

#### Step 3: Update Your Information

Modify the values in the `data` object to reflect your personal information. Replace the placeholders with your own details.

Example: Update `name`, `city`, `slogan`, `avatar`, and other personal information fields.

#### Step 4: Add Social Media Links

In the `socialMedia` array, add your social media profiles.

Provide the `name` (e.g., "twitter," "facebook").

If applicable, provide the `url` and `background` color for each profile. Feel free to add logos for each socialMedia if desired.

#### Step 5: List Your Tools and Technologies

Update the `tools` array with the tools and technologies you are familiar with or have experience using. Feel free to add logos for each tool if desired.

#### Step 6: Provide Your Details

In the `details` object, update the following sections:

- `about`: Write a brief description about yourself, your skills, and your passion for web development.
- `goals`: Describe your career goals and aspirations.
- `experience`: Highlight your experience as a web developer, including your skills and the technologies you've worked with.

In the `details` object, you can add additional fields, and they will be automatically included with the key as the title.

For example:

```javascript
{
  details: {
    about: "Your about description here...",
    goals: "Your goals description here...",
    experience: "Your experience description here...",
    // Add more custom fields here, and they will be included with key as title.
    customField1: "Custom field 1 description...",
    customField2: "Custom field 2 description...",
    "Custom Field 3": "Custom field 3 description...",
    "I love the ocean": "The great ocean...",
  },
}
```

#### Step 7: Add Your Projects

Under the `projects` array, include details for your projects. Each project should have:

- `id`: A unique identifier for the project.
- `title`: The project's title.
- `subtitle`: A short description or subtitle for the project.
- `image`: The path to the project's image/logo.
- `color`: A color associated with the project (if applicable).
- `details`: Provide an overview, approach, your role, and the tools used for each project.

#### Step 8: Include Project Assets (if applicable)

If your projects have associated images or assets, specify the image paths in the `assets` array for each project.

#### Step 9: Save Your Changes

After updating the `data.js` file with your information and project details, save the file.

#### Step 10: Review and Test

Double-check your changes to ensure accuracy. You can also run your application to verify that the data is correctly displayed.

#### Step 11: Commit Your Changes

If you're using version control (e.g., Git), commit your changes to save your progress.

By following these steps, you'll have a well-structured `data.js` file containing your personal information and project details for your application.
